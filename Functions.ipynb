        "Q1 -  What is the difference between a function and a method in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "  ANS - In Python, both **functions** and **methods** are callable objects that perform specific actions or computations, but there are key differences between them:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Function**\n",
        "- A **function** is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It is defined using the `def` keyword and can be called independently.\n",
        "- Functions can exist independently of any object.\n",
        "- They are not tied to any particular class or object.\n",
        "  \n",
        "**Example of a function**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name):\n",
        "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "  \n",
        "# Calling the function\n",
        "print(greet(\"Alice\"))\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Method**\n",
        "- A **method** is essentially a function, but it is associated with an **object** or a **class**.\n",
        "- Methods are called on an object or class, and they can access or modify the state of the object they belong to.\n",
        "- In Python, methods are always defined within a class, and they typically take the object (instance) itself as their first parameter, conventionally named `self`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example of a method**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "    def greet(self):\n",
        "        return f\"Hello, {self.name}!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an object (instance) of the Person class\n",
        "person = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Calling the method\n",
        "print(person.greet())  # This is a method call\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Differences:\n",
        "1. **Association**:\n",
        "   - A **function** is not associated with any object or class.\n",
        "   - A **method** is associated with an object or class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Calling**:\n",
        "   - Functions are called by their name: `function()`.\n",
        "   - Methods are called on an object or class: `object.method()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **First Parameter**:\n",
        "   - In a **function**, there is no implicit first parameter (unless you're using decorators or other structures).\n",
        "   - In a **method**, the first parameter is always the object or class instance (`self` for instance methods, `cls` for class methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2 - Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ANS - In Python, **function arguments** and **parameters** are closely related concepts that describe how data is passed into a function. However, they refer to different things:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Function Parameters**\n",
        "- **Parameters** are the names listed in the function definition.\n",
        "- They act as placeholders that define what type of values a function expects when it is called.\n",
        "- Parameters are local variables inside the function that can be used in the function body.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example of parameters**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name, age):  # 'name' and 'age' are parameters\n",
        "    return f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "- `name` and `age` are parameters.\n",
        "- They define what kind of information the function expects when called.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Function Arguments**\n",
        "- **Arguments** are the actual values you pass into a function when you call it.\n",
        "- They correspond to the parameters defined in the function, and they are supplied in the function call.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example of arguments**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "greet(\"Alice\", 30)  # 'Alice' and 30 are arguments\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here:\n",
        "- `\"Alice\"` and `30` are arguments.\n",
        "- They are passed to the function and assigned to the parameters `name` and `age` inside the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points:\n",
        "- **Parameters** are like placeholders or variables that are defined when you define a function.\n",
        "- **Arguments** are the actual values you pass to the function when you call it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "Python allows various ways to pass arguments to a function. Here's a rundown of common argument types:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Positional Arguments**\n",
        "These are arguments passed to a function in the correct order, matching the parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def multiply(a, b):\n",
        "    return a * b\n",
        "\n",
        "result = multiply(3, 4)  # '3' and '4' are positional arguments\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: 12\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Keyword Arguments**\n",
        "With keyword arguments, you can pass values by specifying the parameter name, allowing you to pass arguments in any order.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name, age):\n",
        "    return f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "greet(age=25, name=\"Bob\")  # 'age' and 'name' are keyword arguments\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, `age=25` and `name=\"Bob\"` are keyword arguments. You can use them in any order.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Default Arguments**\n",
        "You can assign default values to parameters. If the caller doesn't provide an argument for that parameter, the default value is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name, age=18):  # 'age' has a default value of 18\n",
        "    return f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "greet(\"Alice\")  # Uses the default value for 'age'\n",
        "greet(\"Bob\", 30)  # 'age' is explicitly set to 30\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- In the first call, `age` uses the default value of `18`.\n",
        "- In the second call, `age` is explicitly set to `30`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Arbitrary Arguments (`*args`)**\n",
        "You can use `*args` to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a function. This collects the arguments into a tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def add_numbers(*args):  # 'args' is a tuple of arguments\n",
        "    return sum(args)\n",
        "\n",
        "print(add_numbers(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 6\n",
        "print(add_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))  # Output: 15\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Arbitrary Keyword Arguments (`**kwargs`)**\n",
        "`**kwargs` allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. These arguments are collected into a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def print_info(**kwargs):  # 'kwargs' is a dictionary of keyword arguments\n",
        "    for key, value in kwargs.items():\n",
        "        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "print_info(name=\"Alice\", age=30)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This will print:\n",
        "```\n",
        "name: Alice\n",
        "age: 30\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 6. **Keyword-Only Arguments**\n",
        "You can define arguments that must be passed using keywords, even if they're listed after positional arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name, *, age):\n",
        "    return f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "greet(\"Alice\", age=30)  # Correct usage\n",
        "greet(\"Bob\", 25)  # Error: 'age' must be passed as a keyword argument\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the `age` argument must be passed by keyword (not positionally).\n",
        "\n",

        "ANS - In Python, there are several ways to **define** and **call** functions. The flexibility of Python allows for various syntaxes and techniques, each with its own use case. Here's a breakdown of the different ways to define and call functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Basic Function Definition and Call**\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the most common and straightforward way to define and call a function. You use the `def` keyword to define a function and call it using its name.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 2. **Function with Default Arguments**\n",
        "\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Arbitrary Positional Arguments (`*args`)**\n",
        "\n",
        "If you don’t know beforehand how many positional arguments will be passed to the function, you can use `*args`. This collects extra arguments into a tuple.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **State Retention**:\n",
        "   - A regular function executes all its code when called and returns a value once. After returning, the function's state is lost.\n",
        "   - A generator, on the other hand, retains its state between calls (because of the `yield` statement). Every time you call `next()`, the generator resumes where it left off.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Return Behavior**:\n",
        "   - A regular function uses `return` to send a value back and exit the function.\n",

Let's explore the main advantages of using generators:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Memory Efficiency**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Generators**:\n",
        "- **Memory-efficient** because they produce values on-the-fly and don't store them all in memory.\n",
        "- When you use `yield`, values are generated one at a time and released to the caller, keeping memory usage minimal.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Regular Functions**:\n",
        "- Regular functions (especially those that return large collections like lists) need to store the entire output in memory before returning it. This can lead to high memory consumption, particularly when dealing with large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**:\n",
        "If you need to generate a sequence of 1 million numbers, using a generator will only store one number in memory at a time, while a regular function that returns a list will store all 1 million numbers in memory at once.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 2. **Lazy Evaluation (On-Demand Computation)**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Generators**:\n",
        "- **Lazy evaluation** means values are generated only when requested. This is useful when you don’t need all the results at once or when you're dealing with potentially infinite sequences.\n",
        "- This allows for better performance, as computation and memory consumption are spread out over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Regular Functions**:\n",

        "- When dealing with large datasets, regular functions may struggle because they need to compute and store the entire result, leading to higher CPU and memory overhead.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "In the first example, the generator yields one line at a time, avoiding the need to store the entire file in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Support for Infinite Sequences**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Generators**:\n",
        "- **Infinite sequences**: Generators can model infinite sequences, which are not possible with regular functions that return all their results at once. This is useful for algorithms that work with infinite data streams (like generating prime numbers, Fibonacci sequences, etc.).\n",

        "\n",
        "#### **Generators**:\n",

        "\n",
        "#### **Regular Functions**:\n",
        "- Regular functions cannot pause and resume execution. Once a function completes execution (after returning a value), it cannot continue without being called again, and any intermediate state is lost.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Single Expression**:\n",
        "   - A lambda function can only contain a single expression. It automatically returns the result of that expression, and you don’t need to use the `return` keyword.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **In Functional Programming**:\n",

        "\n",
        "  ANS -  ### **Purpose and Usage of the `map()` Function in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `map()` function in Python is used to apply a specified function to each item in an iterable (like a list, tuple, or set) and return an **iterator** that yields the results. Essentially, `map()` allows you to perform operations on each item in an iterable without the need for explicit loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of `map()` is to streamline the process of applying a transformation or computation to every element in an iterable. This helps make your code more concise and often more readable, especially when performing simple operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Syntax of `map()`**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "map(function, iterable, ...)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- `function`: The function that will be applied to every item in the iterable(s).\n",
        "- `iterable`: One or more iterables (lists, tuples, etc.) whose items the function will be applied to.\n",
        "- You can pass **multiple iterables** to `map()`. If you do so, the function should accept as many arguments as there are iterables.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `map()` function returns an **iterator**, not a list. You can convert the iterator to a list or other collection types using `list()`, `tuple()`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Basic Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look at a simple example where we use `map()` to apply a function to each element of a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Function to square a number\n",
        "def square(x):\n",
        "    return x * x\n",
        "\n",
        "# List of numbers\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using map to apply square function to each element in numbers\n",
        "squared_numbers = map(square, numbers)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Converting the map object to a list to see the results\n",
        "print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here:\n",
        "- The `map()` function applies the `square()` function to each element of the list `numbers`.\n",
        "- The result is an iterator that yields the squared values. We use `list()` to convert the iterator to a list so we can see the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Using Lambda Functions with `map()`**\n",
        "\n",
        "A common usage of `map()` is with **lambda functions**, where you can define a small, anonymous function to be applied to each element.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Using lambda to square each number\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Convert the result to a list and print\n",
        "print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `lambda x: x ** 2` function is applied to each number in the `numbers` list.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Using Multiple Iterables with `map()`**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can pass multiple iterables to `map()`, and the function should accept as many arguments as there are iterables. The function will be applied to the elements of the iterables in parallel.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let’s add corresponding elements from two lists:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Function to add two numbers\n",
        "def add(x, y):\n",
        "    return x + y\n",
        "\n",
        "# Two lists of numbers\n",
        "list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "list2 = [4, 5, 6]\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using map to apply the add function to corresponding elements of the two lists\n",
        "result = map(add, list1, list2)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Convert the result to a list and print\n",
        "print(list(result))  # Output: [5, 7, 9]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here:\n",
        "- `map()` applies the `add()` function to corresponding pairs of elements from `list1` and `list2`.\n",
        "- The result is `[5, 7, 9]`, which is the sum of each pair of elements from the two lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Important Notes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Lazy Evaluation**: `map()` returns an iterator, which means it doesn’t immediately execute the function on all items. Instead, it evaluates the function lazily when you iterate over the result. You can use `list()`, `tuple()`, or a `for` loop to get the result.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Multiple Iterables**: When using multiple iterables, `map()` will stop when the shortest iterable is exhausted. If the iterables have different lengths, the result will only include the elements up to the length of the shortest iterable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Performance**: Because `map()` works with iterators, it can be more memory efficient than using a loop with lists, especially for large datasets. It’s also faster than manually iterating through the elements using a `for` loop in many cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Common Use Cases of `map()`**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Transforming Data**: Applying a transformation to each element in an iterable (e.g., squaring each element, converting strings to uppercase).\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Combining Data**: Using multiple iterables to combine data in a functional way, such as adding elements from two lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Applying Complex Functions**: Applying a complex function to each element without the need to write a full loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example 1: Converting Strings to Integers**\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose you have a list of strings that represent numbers, and you want to convert them to integers:\n",
